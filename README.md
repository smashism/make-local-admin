make-local-admin
================

This script creates a local admin account on a machine during imaging

RealName should be the name you want your admin to be, e.g. "killertofu".

Picture should be exact path; you can find them all in /Library/User Pictures/.

The rest is self-explanatory.

This script is ideal for imaging scenarios where you are using a true vanilla OS (like using AutoDMG to deploy) and need to ensure a local user admin is created.
